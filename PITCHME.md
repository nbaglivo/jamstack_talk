The Jamstack 101

Note:

- This is just a really basic intro to what the Jamstack is, if you have already work with this or head of this, or even visited the
Jamstack site then chances are that you don't neeed this talk and you probably know more than I do

@title[what]


Unlike other known stacks like MEAN or LAMP, the Jamstack is not about specific technologies.

@title[what]

The idea is prerender HTML on deploy-time and to distribute the resulting static web app but to enhance the static
experience with the use of JavaScript, APIs, and Markup.

Note:

- Instead of rendering a web site dynamically in the browser, this approach makes use of an old idea. It suggests to prerender HTML on deploy-time and to distribute the resulting static web app – but without the static experience. To achieve this the JAMstack makes use of JavaScript, APIs, and Markup.

---

@title[javascript]

JavaScript enables elements of a static site to become highly dynamic. 

---
@title[APIs]

APIs handle things like authentication, data processing, saving input and stuff.

Note:

- APIs are required due to the fact that JAMstack apps are serverless. This means that there is no backend code required to be run on a server. Developers can solely focus on implementing their apps’ frontend logic. Consequently common backend tasks such as saving user input, image processing, or authentication need to be handled by external services providing abstracted, public APIs.

---
@title[Markup]

Markup templates are prebuilt in the deployment process including the site’s content. This can be accomplished with static site generators or other build tools for web applications.
